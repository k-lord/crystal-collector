## How to Play
- A random target number will be generated at the start of the game.
- There are four crystals that also have random values. These values are unknown to you until you click on them.
- Each time you click on a crystal, its value is added to your total score.
- You win the game by matching your total score to the random number.
- You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.
- Each time when the game starts, the game will change the value of each crystal, as well as your target number.
